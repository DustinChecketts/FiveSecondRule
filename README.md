- Tracks mana "ticks"** as movement left-to-right
- Simple vertical line or "spark" that moves horizontally across the mana bar
- Displays the mana gained each tick to the right of the mana bar as "+50"

<h4>Vocabulary</h4>

- *The "five-second-rule" refers to the necessary time to elapse after spending mana before mana regeneration will resume.
- **A "tick" is a measure of time used for over-time effects. Mana regeneration uses 2-second "ticks".
